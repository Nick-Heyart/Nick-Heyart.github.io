# The BT770 Headphones
The Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro is widely regarded to be one of the best headphones available, both for professional and casual use. However, there is no wireless variant officially available from Beyerdynamic, and most existing Bluetooth mods for the DT770 involve installing a RJ45 or MiniXLR in place of the wire, then connecting them to a bluetooth receiver and clipping it to the frame of the headphones. I did not find this to be a suitable solution, so I set out to do something more ambitious.

## Design Overview
This mod replaces the DT770's housing with a custom 3D printed housing that holds the electronics from a JBL(something), integrating buttons and charging directly into the headphone. I used the JBL(something) because of its good battery life, USB-C charging, and intuitive controls, but it should be pretty easy to adapt the design to a different board. To keep the frequency response the same, I used a "double-decker" design where the driver is in its own isolated chamber whose volume is the same as the original housing. The electronics sit on top of this chamber, underneath a cap that can be un-clipped easily. The left side contains the JBL board and all the headphones controls, and the right side holds the battery and RJ45 input. 

## Shortcomings
Overall, these are excellent headphones. These have been my primary headphones for a few years and all I have are some minor complaints. First is the bulkiness; these are quite comfortable due to the ample padding, but they have left a dent in the top of my head after a few years of use. To be clear, I am not taking about hair. My skin or possibly even my bone structure has changed due to the weight of the headphones. They also stick out pretty far due to the double-decker system, and look pretty ridiculous as a result. A future redesign would probably ditch double-decker in favor of a custom PCB(s) that is curved to fit around the perimeter of the crown, eliminating the need for a second chamber or long wire runs.

The buttons are also sub-par in my opinion. You can hear them rattle if you move your head quickly, and they can fall out when you take off the cap or drop the headphones. Their small structures are also difficult to print on lower-end printers like my Anet A8. Since designing these, I have seen the insides of many more headphones. Some Skullcandy headphones use one large piece of silicone instead of separate pieces of plastic; this should be easy to replicate with TPU filament and solves both of the problems mentioned earlier.

The headphone jack on the right headphone used to work but is currently non-functional. I am pretty certain that this is due to the port being held in with failing hot glue, causing at least one of the solder joints to break. You also have to manually switch between inputs, while other headphones switch automatically. A future revision would use a board with an integrated RJ45 and switching circuitry. Having USB audio input through a more conveniently positioned USB-C port would also be nice.

This last issue isn't a problem with the design itself, but you should really avoid printing this out of PLA. My pair has slowly developed cracks in various places, and the eventual failure of that plastic will probably be the reason I revisit this project in the future. I had to re-print the caps out of PETG because the brittle PLA clips kept breaking, hence the color mismatch.

## Plans for BT770 overhaul
As mentioned earlier, the fragile PLA I used to make the first version is sure to fail. Rather than using the same, flawed design a second time, I will start (mostly) from scratch and use two custom PCBs, one on each side of the headphone.
