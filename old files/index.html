			<h2>Welcome!</h2>
			<p>Welcome to my portfolio! Here you will find information about me, my school projects, as well as a few personal projects. Feel free to visit older portfolios, but don't expect them to be as well formatted as this one.</p>
			<h3>What you'll find in each section</h3>
			<p>The "DRSS" section isn't really a section. That button is just a link to the official school website.</p>
			<p>The "Portfolio" dropdown has links to previous portfolio websites, so you can see what projects I did in previous years. You can also see my progression in website design over the years, both in the user interface and in the techniques used in the code.</p>

			<h2>What I have planned for this site</h2>
			<p>I plan on documenting all of my personal projects here at some point in the future. Unless I have oodles of free time next year, there probably won't be any major changes to the aesthetics of this site. Future portfolios will also probably come in the form of additions to this site. If you are familiar with the portfolios of other people at DRSS, you will probably have noticed that this site's URL is a bit different from the others. This is because it is not being hosted on the school servers. I am doing this because the school server has tons of hoops to jump through just to do trivial tasks, such as show a video or use i-frames. It also requires a password that will likely become invalid when I graduate, which is kind of a big deal since I want to be able to make updates here for years and years to come. The only interaction I see myself having with the school server in the future is making a simple redirect that leads here.</p>

			<h3> Visual Effects and Video Editing </h3>
			<p> I didn't think I would enjoy the video editing workflow as much as I do, but here I am doing it in my free time. You can see a sample of my work at the top of this website. I us Adobe Premiere Pro for basic video editing, After Effects for compositing, Fusion 360 and Blender for 3D modeling, Blender and Unreal Engine 4 for 3D rendering, and GIMP for photo editing. </p>
			<h3> 3D Printing </h3>
			<p> I have a heavily modified Anet A8 which can be seen in the video at the top of the site. I've replaced the extruder with a Bowden based E3D volcano 6 clone. Tensioners have been added to all axies, all belts have been upgraded to more durable latex-based belts, and a servo mounted switch allows for automatic bed leveling. Speaking of the bed, I use a 200mm X 200mm sheet of glass for a print surface. I have to run it at a higher bed temperature than I would otherwise, but the smooth first layer and easy print removal is well worth it. <br />
				I also have a DaVinci Minimaker that is currently in the process of being "unlocked". The stock electronics use an RF-ID based system to restrict you to using only DaVinci brand filament, which is very over-priced. So, I am replacing the stock electronics with an open-source RAMPS system that allows the use of custom G-code, and is free of any artificial restrictions. Needless to say, the process has been less than seamless. I'll update this section when I get it printing. </p>
			<h3> PC Building </h3>
			<p> I don't have the budget to support more than one PC, but my PC has never gone longer than one month without some sort of change in hardware. Right now it's got an RX580, a Ryzen 2600, and 16GB of RAM. However, the most eye-catching feature of my setup is definitely the four monitors, even if all of them came from libraries, thrift stores and broken chromebooks. </p>
