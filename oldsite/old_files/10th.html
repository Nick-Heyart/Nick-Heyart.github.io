      <h2>Entry 1</h2>
      <p>This year, while not over, has been challenging. I have struggled on many projects and
assignments. The Historical Blackout Poetry Project, the Chinese School Life Video Project, and
the Language Arts Individual Role Project to be specific. But, despite these challenges, I got
though all of them with passing grades via adaptation. This way of quickly adapting to each
challenge is as valuable, if not more valuable than the content of the class itself.</p>
      <p>The Historical Blackout Poetry Project required both a poem, and art. I am particularly
bad at both of these, so I had to figure out a way to make up for both of these shortcomings. The
poem had to be made using only words from an excerpt of a story, so I first made a poem that
related to the subject using traditional vocabulary, then re-worded it to work with the excerpt.
With the poem taken care of, I had to make a black and white art piece to go with the poem.
While I cannot draw, I can Photoshop and trace. So, I found a picture of a soldier taken from the
side, then I made it into a silhouette via Photoshop. I printed out the silhouette and then traced it
onto the paper. So, I manipulated my methods to fit my strengths and weaknesses. This strategy
of adaptation would prove very useful in the future.</p>
	  <p>The Chinese School Life Video Project required acting, and Chinese speaking. I struggle
with both of these, however my ability to edit slow, stutter-filled speech into fluent, confident, and clear speech more than made up for my poor Chinese speaking. Acting is a bit of a different
story, as you cannot fake it without very advanced video effects. So, we did multiple takes of
each scene with me in it, and I did jump cuts between them whenever I messed up, effectively
simplifying the editing required by multiple orders of magnitude. The result looked surprisingly
natural. The rest of the project was more video editing, which is something I very much excel at.
The video transitions were smooth, and the background music volume was modulated so it
would not interfere with the Chinese narration. I even put English subtitles on the YouTube
version. Sure enough, our group got full marks.</p>
	  <p>The Language Arts Individual Role Project had 3 parts. There was an essay, an artifact
that could be in a media of our choosing, and an oral presentation. I chose to make a video for
the artifact, making the essay and presentation the only real challenges. My typing speed is far
below average, making the high word count requirement a challenge not only to fill up with
content, but to get that content into the essay within a reasonable amount of time. To combat my
slow typing speed, I refrained from procrastinating on the essay. I started right away with about 8
sentences. These 8 sentences met all the content requirements. All I had to do was use a
technique I call “inflation”. This is where you re-word single sentences to be paragraphs,
splitting it into about 5 parts, then making each part a grammatically correct sentence. These
sentences can be further expanded, allowing for almost infinite expansion. I used this technique
to far exceed the word count, and give myself the bragging rights to a 7 paragraph essay. As for
the presentation, I find it much easier to make attention holding presentations when backed up by
a PowerPoint. The PowerPoint assists in the presentation of things that are difficult to describe
with words, as both audio and visual media can easily be shown to everybody observing the
essay. This made presenting much easier, and set up my video artifact quite well.</p>
	  <p>In conclusion, I adapted my strengths and weaknesses to fit my challenges. In rare cases,
I manipulated the challenges to fit my strengths and weaknesses, like finding a weak point in a
stick where it can be broken by hand. While it can be argued that the skills we learn in school
will not help us in our adult lives, the ability to adapt has, and will continue to be essential in
everyday life. So if you believe that a class will not help you later in life, then shift your focus
from the content itself to the challenges it presents. You might just prove yourself wrong.</p>

      <h2>Entry 2</h2>
      <p>This entry will outline three more projects, but from the second semester this time.</p>
	  <h3>The Cancer PSA</h3>
	  <p>In the Cancer PSA project, we were put in groups of 8 people, and had to make a PSA about a type
of cancer of our choice. We chose breast cancer. Everybody was assigned a role. The roles were
director, assistant director, actor, script writer, crew, and video editor. I got video editor. While I had
made plenty of videos before, the type of things I did in this video were starting to cross the line into
VFX territory. While video editing has always just been a kind of side talent that is useful in a handful
of projects for me, this project showed me how easy it is to get impressive results with a few simple
techniques.</p>
	  <h3>The Chinese Student Life Project</h3>
	  <p>The student life project was a smaller project for Chinese 2. It was like the cancer PSA project, but it
had a much shorter timeframe and the groups were only 4 people. No roles were assigned, so
everybody just had to help wherever they could. The goal was to make a video overview of student
life in the US that could be sent to Chinese students. I also got a lot more help from the group with
editing than the Cancer PSA. This showed me that getting a job in a team of video editors or VFX
artists might be a good career path for me, as the workflow is not that different from what we did
while editing this video.</p>
	  <h3>The Health Poster Project</h3>
	  <p>The health poster project for wellness was a pretty long project where we would choose a food that
reduces the risk of cancer and other health problems and make a superhero style poster about them.
The project was done in groups of 2. My group’s poster was nothing to brag about. Neither me or my
partner were good at drawing, so we used photoshop to design our hero, and pasted print-outs of it
on the poster instead. I made an animated short of our superhero, which takes many of the same
skills as video editing. This was the most effort I have ever put into a single video, and you can see
the animation quality increase as the video goes on. This showed me that I also might want to get
into animation, as it is a really useful skill, especially for making info-graphic videos, or info-graphic
segments in videos.</p>
