      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img class="a" src="images/Profile1.png" style="height: 250px;">
      <p>
        Welcome to my website. My name is Nick. I am a graduating senior at the Dayton Regional STEM School and Eagle scout in troop 71. I have lots of hobbies, most of which are technology related. I make videos, 3D animations and artwork, build and
        modify R/C vehicles and planes, Build and maintain FDM 3D printers, Design websites, and build / fix computers. I also like going camping and boating.
      </p>
      <p>
        I plan on becoming an electrical and computer engineer, a field that spans across software and hardware. I was originally split between computer science and electrical engineering. Computer science deals almost exclusively with software, which is a problem because just writing software with no physical component can get pretty boring for me. Electrical engineering works with electric devices in a more general sense, focusing on the physical principles of electricity, but I felt that I would be neglecting my interest in software and computers by choosing it. Then I found out that Wright State University offers a major that is a mix of both of these things, and I knew I had a winner.
      </p>
      <p>I’ve always considered myself to be a sensory person. You may have heard of a game called Detroit: Become human. I did not enjoy playing this game. Its controls are odd and make little sense, its story tells a boring, predictable and unoriginal tale about artificial intelligence and the whole thing is more pretentious than a lecture from your grandparents that starts with “When I was your age…”.</p>
      <p>
        Again, I did not enjoy playing this game and interpreting its messages. But despite this, it is one of my favorite games. This is due solely to the incredible amount fidelity present in its visuals, audio and animations. It immersed me so effectively that I did not recognize the poor writing until reflecting on it later. Its characters somehow manage to look more real and have more detail than what I see when I actually look at a real person. Similar things can be said for its sound design, animations and everything else that makes up what I like to call the “sensory component”.
      </p>
      <p>This concentration on the sensory component reflects in my unironic work wherever applicable, though without compromise to the other qualities. I frequently go above and beyond on video projects, sometimes not intentionally. When working on something that requires a balance of function and form, I get the function part down first. Until function is achieved, form serves as motivation. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Videos and animations</h2>
      <p>
        I started out making videos for a language arts school project. I used Adobe Premiere Pro and GIMP, and it was pretty good as far as school videos went. I did 2 more school videos and 2 short meme videos experimenting with more advanced
        software like After Effects. My first real video was a completely unnecessary compliment to a health poster project in a wellness/fitness class. It was a little under 3 minutes long and drew inspiration from the “surreal” memes that can be
        found on channels like Timotainment. The video is called “WAHOOOOOOOOO...” and is my best performing video to this day. This video pushed Premiere Pro’s animation capabilities to the absolute limit, and I knew the next ambitious video I made
        would have to use some more advanced software.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was the start of a new school year, and my language arts class was back at it with the video projects. This time I tried using a completely new piece of software called Blender. Blender is very different from Adobe products. While Adobe
        products are specialized, expensive, resource intensive and closed source, Blender is generalized, free, highly optimized and open source. Blender’s primary function is to generate 3D visuals, it is capable of video editing, photo editing, 3D
        modeling, color grading, 2D animation, and probably 20 other things I don’t even know about yet. That being said, it has a learning curve more equivalent to a cliff covered in WD-40, and I needed to scale this cliff in a matter of hours in
        order to get this project done on time.
      </p>

      <h2>R/C veihcles</h2>
      <p>
        When I was little, my favorite toy was a remote-control car. That was the only thing I would ask for on my birthdays and Christmas lists, until one year when I mixed it up and asked for a remote-control car that could fly. That year, Santa brought me cheap helicopter toy. But along with it came a whole new interest. I could barley pilot the thing, but I quickly realized that it was way cooler than any car I had seen before. I used my precision piloting skills to smack it into the celling. I don’t think it flew again after that, but suddenly cars weren’t at the top of my Christmas lists.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later on, I saved up my money multiple times and bought cheap drones from a local shop. I got one called the “Skywalker” that had a cage around it, making it resistant to crashes. It was with this that I expanded my pallet of tricks past the “wall whack” and “celling slam”. Fast forward a few years and I now use drone simulators to do fancy flips and rolls and dizzying spirals, all without the extra weight of a cage but without the lingering fear of sending a $600 hunk of metal and carbon fiber for an unplanned bath in your neighbor’s pool.
      </p>
      <p>I also built one from scratch, which you can see on my 11th grade page.</p>

      <h2>3D printing</h2>
      <p>
        From my first time seeing one at a tech convention when I was little, 3D printers have always fascinated me. I bugged the guy representing the company for hours on end, watched 40-minute demo prints from start to finish, and even got to take one home with me.

        I now have one of my own. Its an Anet A8, the cheapest printer worth getting. The way it comes is functional but not ideal to say the least. Parts like the extruder assembly have been completely replaced, and various other changes have improved its capabilities significantly. Thanks to some opportunities from my school, I often find myself in makerspaces managing many printers and answering the questions of other curious people, much like that guy from the convention. Funny how that works.

      <h2>PC building</h2>
      <p>
        Wright State has a program called ESPM (Excess And Surplus Management). This is where I got my first desktop computer from. It was pretty old, but not as old as most of the other machines in there. I think I was 14 at the time. Unlike those unfortunate enough to be confined to laptops, I quickly realized the modularity of my machine. It came with a lackluster graphics card that was barely enough to play older games like Portal, but thanks to the generosity of my sister’s dance teacher’s brother, I got my hands on an old but superior card. Just like that, I was able to play most indie games with no trouble at all. It wasn’t until I got a VR headset that I realized that I was using hardware from 2009. It was causing compatibility issues with the headset, prompting me to replace most of my computer’s internals.

        New motherboard, new CPU and new RAM. Some of these came as Christmas gifts, including a new case that took up less space. My VR headset was working fine now, but about the old parts? I sold the motherboard and RAM on eBay, so hopefully they are powering someone else’s shoestring setup at this very moment. The CPU, however, was so thoroughly obsolete that I couldn’t even give it away. I think it still sits in a box in my basement, destined to become e-waste. Though, one tiny nugget of waste out of a whole PC rebuild is far better than the “throw it out and get a new one” model abided by most laptops and all consoles. Various other parts have been swapped out since then, mainly the GPU. My old GPUs get handed down to friends. In fact, as I write this, I can use the power of social media to see that my old RX580 is currently running “Deep Rock Galactic” and my even older R7 260x is running “Team Fortress 2”. I hope my friends are having a good time.
