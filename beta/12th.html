      <h2>Greatest Growth Statement</h2>
      <p>
        My greatest growth since joining DRSS does not have anything to do with a specific skill I’ve learned, but the act of learning itself. At the beginning of high school, I started learning a video editing software. It took me about a week to figure out the features I needed to use to make a video of an acceptable quality. About 1 year ago in 11th grade, I was given a similar assignment using a different video production software. The time frame was much shorter and I was much busier that week, so the time between first opening the software and submitting the final product was less than 24 hours. The software in this case was much more complex, and my final product was considered exceptional. You never know what things you’ll have to adapt to, so I believe this ability will be very relevant to me in the future.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Artifact 1: NKVD Ad</h2>
      <h3>My History as a Very Professional Salesman</h3>
      <p>The NKVD ad was the first time I put a significant amount of effort into a video that was not for school. I had made similar videos before, though they were for a grade in my government class. That class was taught by one of my favorite teachers: Mr. Nunez. School was completely virtual for the first half of that year, and one of the many ways he kept the students’ attention was student-made commercials punctuating sections of his classes. The requirements were:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Advertise a fictional good or service by giving a presentation or playing a video</li>
        <li>Keep it under one minute</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I made two of these, both in the form of videos. I enjoyed making both of these very much, and my classmates seemed to enjoy watching them.
      </p>
      <h3>Another Dimension of Difficulty</h3>
      <p>
        From a technical standpoint, both of these were very simple. They were just images being moved around on screen; the real effort was in the writing. But I wanted to get a little bit more ambitious with my visuals, so I picked up a 3D program called Blender that can do all kinds of graphics related tasks. I originally chose Blender because it was free, but despite its price Blender is a very capable software. However, making 3D graphics has a very steep learning curve.
      </p>
      <p>There are easily hundreds if not thousands of buttons that must be pressed, sliders that must be adjusted and other little actions that must be taken in order to make even a simple 3D scene. For every time you have to navigate through dropdowns in dropdowns or scroll through lists of parameters, those are seconds being used to do something other than the task at hand. Now, a few seconds wasted is no big deal for most tasks, but when you spend a few seconds on something thousands of times, seconds add up into minutes, and minutes into hours. To take all the actions that must be taken to make a 3D scene in such a time-consuming manner would make work go at a snail’s pace. In fact, work did go at a snail’s pace for the first month or so of me using blender. It was like typing by clicking buttons on a screen instead of pressing actual buttons with your fingers. Then I finally bothered to look up a beginner’s tutorial, and found out how heavily Blender uses hotkeys and macros. Rather than wasting time navigating dropdowns or whatnot, you simply make a few keystrokes.
      </p>
      <p>Say I wanted to move an object to the right a bit. let’s also say that “right” in this case happens to be along the X axis. Were I to do this without the use of hotkeys, I would to mouse over to the left side of the screen to select the move tool, then mouse back over to the object I want to move, select it, and then drag the X arrow until I have the position I want. It takes about 2 seconds to get to the part where I’m actually manipulating the object. Using hotkeys, I select the object, press G for grab, and then X to lock it to the X axis. This takes about half a second, 400% faster than using a mouse to do everything. Not only did hotkeys make me much faster, but some features of blender are only accessible through them.
      </p>
      <p>The problem with hotkeys is that you have to learn them. This took (and is still taking me) a very long time.

      <h2>Artifact 5: CATIA Learning Log</h2>
      <h3>Sub-title</h3>
      <p>
        [I have recently picked up a new CAD software called CATIA. It is widely used throughout various industries. If you were to work as an engineer for a big company like Honda or GE, CATIA is what you would be using to do your work. It has been known to be somewhat unintuitive and hard to learn, though it is widely recognized as the fastest and most capable CAD software out there. I want to document my learning progress on a daily basis and compare it to when I learned Autodesk Inventor back in 10th grade.]
