# Boss Fight Render Challenge
Every few months, VFX artist and YouTuber Clint ["Pwnisher"](https://www.youtube.com/@pwnisher) Jones hosts a render competition where thousands of artists submit 3D renders, each one based on a template that allows for consistent camera movement between submissions. After the submission deadline, all submissions are compiled into one youtube video where each render smoothly transitions into the next. This article details my submission into the boss fight themed challenge.

## Outline
There were 3 templates available, each with a different distance between the boss and the hero. I chose to have the greatest distance, since I planned to have the hero face off against an angel in a vast cathedral.
